# SkillSavvy_Internship
These are the tasks given by Skill Savvy as part of my internship as Java Intern.

**JAVA INTERNSHIP(WEEK 1)**

Task 1: Simple Calculator Application 

- Objective: Create a basic calculator application in Java.
- Functionality: Your program should be capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Details: Your task is to design a user-friendly interface that allows users to input two numbers and choose the operation they want to perform. The program should then display the result of the operation.

 ------>>>  Procedure:
  Add the required files from "Week-1 task-1 " file and run the java code.

Task 2: Number Guessing Game

- Objective: Develop a simple number guessing game in Java.
- Functionality: The computer generates a random number, and the user's objective is to guess it.
- Details: Your game should generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). Users will input their guesses, and your program should provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Additionally, keep track of the number of attempts the user makes and display this count when they guess correctly.
  
 ------>>>    Procedure:
  Add the required files from "NumGuess_Task2 " file and compile & run the "NumGuessingGame.java" java code.


**JAVA INTERNSHIP(WEEK 2)**

Week 2 Project: Link Shortener Development

For your next project, we have an exciting and practical task for you â€“ the creation of a "Link Shortener." This project will provide you with hands-on experience in developing a useful and efficient tool.

Project Overview:
Your task is to design and build a link shortener application in Java. A link shortener takes long URLs and converts them into shorter, more user-friendly links. This project will enhance your Java programming skills and allow you to create a functional utility.

Project Details:
1. Shortening Algorithm: Develop an algorithm to convert long URLs into shorter links. You can choose from various methods, including base conversion, hashing, or encoding.

2. User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for users to input long URLs and receive shortened links as output.

3. Short Link Storage: Implement a system to store the mappings between short links and their corresponding long URLs.

 ------>>>    Procedure:
   The  Required files are URLShortener.java and URLShortenerGUI.java
   Compile both the files and run the URLShortenerGUI.java file.
